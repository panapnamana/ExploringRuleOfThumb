# ExploringRuleOfThumb

is a jupyter notebook containing interactive python plots
to explore the rule of thumb wich says, when it is ok to use
a normal distribution to approximate a binomial distribution.
The rule is often stated as:
It is OK to approximate a binomial distribution using a normal distribution if
n*p*(1-p) > 9

The first plot shows both distributions for a given choic of n and p.
The second plot shows the difference between the two.
